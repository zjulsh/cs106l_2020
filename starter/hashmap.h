* Template class for a HashMap
*
* K = key type
* M = mapped type
* H = hash function type used to hash a key; if not provided, defaults to std::hash<K>
*
* Notes: When dealing with the Stanford libraries, we often call M the value
* (and maps store key/value pairs).
*
* However, we name it M for mapped type to avoid confusion with value_type.
* value_type is what the container is storing, which is a std::pair<const K, M>.
*
* All STL containers have a value_type and STL algorithms may use the value_type alias,
* so we try our best to follow that convention.
*
* Example:
*      HashMap<std::string, int>
*      This means K = key = std::string,
*                 M = mapped = int,
*                 value_type = std::pair<const std::string, int>.
*
* Concept requirements:
*      - H is function type that takes in some type K, and outputs a size_t.
*      - K and M must be regular (copyable, default constructible, and equality comparable).
