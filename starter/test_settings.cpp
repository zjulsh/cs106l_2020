    1A/B - rehash
    2A - indexing operator[]
    2B - stream insertion operator<<
    2C - equality operators (== and !=)
    2D - const correctness (compiler errors indicate your functions aren't const correct)
    3A - copy constructor and assignment
    3B - move constructor and assignment (only tests correctness, will pass even if you only implemented copy)
    3C - move constructor + assignment   (tests efficiency, will not pass if you only implemented copy)
